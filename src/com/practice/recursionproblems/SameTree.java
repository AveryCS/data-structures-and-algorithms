/**Problem statement:
 Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

 Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

 Example 1:
 Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
 Output: true

 Example 2:
 Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
 Output: false

 Example 3:
 Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
 Output: false

 Constraints:
 The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
 -104 <= Node.val <= 104
