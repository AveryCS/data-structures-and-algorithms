# Data Structures and Algorithms

I compiled this repo by speaking with countless software engineers who have cracked the coding interview. They helped me narrow down the concepts and types of problems to focus on.

This repo includes concepts that come up often in technical interviews, such as:

#### Breadth First Search
#### Depth First Search
#### Binary Search
#### Sorting algorithms
#### Much more!


# Helpful resources
A lot of these solutions can be very challenging to wrap your head around at first. So, here are some of my favorite resources that help to explain them in laymanâ€™s terms:
